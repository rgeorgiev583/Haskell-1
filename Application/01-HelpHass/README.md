# Help Hass meet his friends

Hass has a problem. He has a meeting with his friends, but is a little too late, so he'll have to travel by train. Hass knows the schedule, but doesn't have enough time to figure out the fastest route.

Help Hass decide which trains to pick!

* Every train travels 5 minutes from its first to its last station.
* Hass is living near the station H and he needs to get to station L.
* There will always be a way to reach the destination.
